/**
 * The Nx CLI uses the https://www.npmjs.com/package/v8-compile-cache package
 * to gain some performance benefits, but that package is not compatible with
 * ESM code and breaks if ESM code is imported. The Nx plugin for Astro relies
 * on the @astrojs/compiler package to populate the project graph dependencies
 * and that package is ESM. Therefore, we patch the Nx CLI and remove the usage
 * of the v8-compile-cache package.
 *
 * Note: this is only an issue when computing the project graph with the Nx Daemon
 * disabled (e.g. in CI environments).
