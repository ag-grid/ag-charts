6.  ### International Transfers {% id="intl-transfers" %}

    ***

    Countries outside of the European Economic Area **(EEA)** do not always offer the same levels of protection to your personal data, so European law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside of the EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria.

    Many of our third party service providers are based outside the European Economic Area **(EEA)** so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

    Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring one of the following safeguards is in place:

    -   We will only transfer your personal data to countries that the European Commission have approved as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data by; or
    -   Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or

    We have procedures in place to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach if we are legally required to.
