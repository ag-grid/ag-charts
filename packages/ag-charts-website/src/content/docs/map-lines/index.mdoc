The Map Line Series visualises geographic lines, such as roads or flight paths, with the ability to vary width and colour to represent data values.

## Simple Map Lines

{% chartExampleRunner title="Lines" name="lines" type="generated" /%}

To create a Map Line Series, use the `map-line` series type and provide data and [topology](./map-topology/). These can be provided in either the chart or series objects.

{% note %}
A Map Line Series should be combined with a [Map Shape Background Series](./map-shapes/#background-shapes).
{% /note %}

```js
data: data,
topology: topology,
series: [
    {
        type: "map-shape-background",
        topology: backgroundTopology,
    },
    {
        type: "map-line",
        idKey: "name",
    },
],
```

In this configuration:

-   Both the `topology` and `data` for the `map-line` series are provided on the chart level.
-   `idKey` defines the property key in the data that will be matched against the property value in the topology.
    See [Connecting Data to Topology](./map-topology/#connecting-data-to-topology) for more details.
-   The `map-shape-background` series has its topology defined on the series level.
-   The `map-shape-background` series is rendered behind the `map-line` series due to their order in the series array.

## Colour Scale

{% chartExampleRunner title="Heatmap" name="heatmap" type="generated" /%}

To colour the lines based on the magnitude of the data, use `colorKey`.

```js
series: [
    {
        type: 'map-line',
        idKey: 'name',
        colorKey: 'dailyVehicles',
        colorName: 'Daily Vehicles'
    },
],
```

In this configuration:

-   `colorKey` is set to 'dailyVehicles', which supplies numerical values for the Colour Scale.
-   `colorName` is optional and configures the display name reflected in [Tooltips](./tooltips/).

{% note %}
See [Colour Range](./heatmap-series/#colour-range) and [Gradient Legend](./heatmap-series/#gradient-legend) for more details about customising these features.
{% /note %}

## Proportional Line Width

{% chartExampleRunner title="Stroke Width" name="stroke-width" type="generated" /%}

To vary the width of the line to denote the magnitude of the data values use `sizeKey`, `strokeWidth` and `maxStrokeWidth`.

```js
series: [
    {
        type: 'map-line',
        idKey: 'name',
        sizeKey: 'dailyVehicles',
        sizeName: 'Daily Vehicles',
        strokeWidth: 1,
        maxStrokeWidth: 3,
    },
],
```

In this configuration:

-   `sizeKey` is set to 'dailyVehicles', which supplies numerical values for the size scale.
-   `sizeName` is optional and configures the display name reflected in [Tooltips](./tooltips/).
-   `strokeWidth` is used for the smallest value in the size scale.
-   `maxStrokeWidth` is used for the largest value in the size scale.

## Background Lines

The Map Line Background Series displays all the lines of a topology without requiring any data.

This can be useful to provide context for other series.

{% chartExampleRunner title="Backgrounds" name="backgrounds" type="generated" /%}

```js
series: [
    {
        type: 'map-line-background',
        topology: backgroundTopology,
    },
    // ...
],
```

{% note %}
As this is a background series rather than a data series, many normal series behaviours are disabled - including interactivity and appearing in the legend.
