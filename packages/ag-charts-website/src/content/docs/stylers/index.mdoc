Stylers allow customisation of the visual appearance of specific items <!-- or series -->based on the data or other conditions.

## Item Stylers

An `itemStyler` is a callback function that is called once for each item within the series. These can be found:

-   In the `series` object, for customising primitive properties on the series level.
-   Inside nested series property objects, such as `marker`. <!-- or label -->

Each `itemStyler` receives a `params` object containing the `datum` of the item, as well as the current styles applied to it.
It should return an object containing the styles to be applied to the item.

The exact details differ between the different series types and components which implement the `itemStyler` function.

{% chartExampleRunner title="Item Styler" name="item-styler" type="generated" /%}

```js
series: [
    {
        type: 'line',
        xKey: 'month',
        yKey: 'coal',
        yName: 'Coal',
        marker: {
            itemStyler: (params) => {
                if (params.datum.coal > params.datum.nuclear) return { fill: 'red', size: 15 };
                else return { fill: p.fill, size: p.size };
            },
        },
    },
    {
        type: 'bar',
        xKey: 'month',
        yKey: 'imported',
        yName: 'Imported',
        itemStyler: ({ datum, xKey, fill, highlighted }) => {
            return {
                fill: datum[xKey] === 'Jul' ? (highlighted ? 'lime' : 'red') : fill,
            };
        },
    },
];
```

In this configuration:

-   The markers in the 'Coal' series will be larger and red if they are higher than 'Nuclear' series for the same month.
-   The 'Imported' series bar for 'Jul' will be red with a lime highlight style.

<!--
## Series Stylers

An `styler` is a callback function that is called once for each series.
These can be found in the `series` object, and are used to change the appearance of the entire series based on a condition.

The Series Styler is most often used within a [Theme](./themes/).

Each `styler` receives a `params` object containing information about the series, as well as the top level styles applied to it.
It should return an object containing the styles to be applied to the series.

Any styling of nested property objects must be done with an `itemStyler`.
