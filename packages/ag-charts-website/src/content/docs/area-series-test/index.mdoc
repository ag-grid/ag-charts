{% chartExampleRunner title="Area Series with Incomplete Data" name="missing-data-area" type="generated" /%}

Test how missing data is handled for a continuous X-axis type (time axis) in Area Series:

-   Initially there is no missing data, all values are valid for their associated axes.
-   Click the Missing Y values button and note that missing Y values are rendered as gaps in the area chart.
-   Click the Missing X values button and note that missing X values causes no data point to be displayed (hence fewer data points shown in the area chart).
-   The second row of buttons allow switching between stacked and grouped area series.
