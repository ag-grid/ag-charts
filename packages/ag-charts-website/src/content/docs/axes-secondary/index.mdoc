Secondary axes are typically used to compare data sets with different scales, with extra axes usually located
on the opposite side of the chart.

## Configuring Secondary Axes

An extra axis configuration is needed to associate a secondary axis with the appropriate series, where the `keys` axis property
links the series to the axis.

```js
axes: [
    // x-axis
    {
        type: 'category',
        position: 'bottom',
    },
    // primary y-axis
    {
        type: 'number',
        position: 'left',
        keys: ['male', 'female'],
    },
    // secondary y-axis
    {
        type: 'number',
        position: 'right',
        keys: ['exportedTonnes'],
    },
];
```

In this configuration:

-   The axis `keys` property on the primary axis (left) matches the `yKeys` of the `column` series.
-   The axis `keys` property on the secondary axis (right) matches the `yKey` of the `line` series.
-   The secondary axis has the `position` of `right`.

Any number of additional axes can be added to a chart using the same method.
