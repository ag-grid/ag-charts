## Initial Load

Switch between the different series types below to see their initial load animations. Toggling items in the legend will also animate the series in and out.

{% chartExampleRunner title="Initial Load" name="initial-load" type="generated" /%}

## Data Updates

A data update animation is split into three sequential phases — remove, update then add. Start and stop the ticking updates below, and toggle the speed at which they occur.

{% chartExampleRunner title="Line Series Data Updates" name="data-updates" type="generated" /%}

## Duration

You can use the `duration` option to specify the length of all animations in milliseconds.

For an initial load, this is simply the duration of the whole animation.

For a data update, the duration is the total time of all three animation phases together — remove, update then add.

```ts
animation: {
    duration: 500,
}
```

In this example, click a duration then change the series type to see the initial load animation.

{% chartExampleRunner title="Duration" name="duration" type="generated" /%}
