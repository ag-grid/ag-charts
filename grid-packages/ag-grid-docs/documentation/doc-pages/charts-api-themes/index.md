Themes are used for configuring the appearance of charts. They can help simplify the chart `options` and avoid duplication if a consistent style is required across multiple charts.

A theme can be provided to a chart by specifying an inbuilt theme name or a custom `AgChartTheme` instance in the `options` object.

For ease of use, The `AgChartTheme` interface is displayed in an interactive, expandable JSON structure below.

<expandable-snippet interfaceName='AgChartTheme' overrideSrc="charts-api/api.json" breadcrumbs='["options", "theme"]' config='{"excludeProperties": ["theme", "data", "container"], "expandedProperties": ["overrides"]}'></expandable-snippet>

You can find more details about AG Charts themes in the [Themes](/charts-themes/) section.
