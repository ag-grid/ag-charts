title: "Axes Overview"

This section explains what chart axes are, how to configure and style them, and which axis type to use in which situation.

A chart uses axes to plot data such as categories and values by converting them to screen coordinates. Since any point on the screen is an `(x, y)` pair of coordinates, a chart needs two orthogonal axes to plot the data &mdash; a horizontal axis to determine the `x` position of a point and a vertical axis to determine the `y` position. Axes also show ticks, labels and grid lines to help the user navigate a chart.
