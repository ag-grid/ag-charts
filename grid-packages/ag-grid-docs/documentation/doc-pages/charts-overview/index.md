Our standalone chart library, AG Charts, is flexible and powerful, enabling creation of charts independently of the grid.

To jump straight in, click through to the [Getting Started](/charts-getting-started/) section, or head to the [API Explorer](/charts-api-explorer/). Alternatively, scroll down for a gallery of examples demonstrating a variety of visualisations created using our library.

As with the grid, the "AG" part of AG Charts stands for "agnostic". The internal AG Charts engine is implemented in TypeScript with zero dependencies. Framework specific AG Charts components allow integration with all major front-end frameworks used to create enterprise applications.
