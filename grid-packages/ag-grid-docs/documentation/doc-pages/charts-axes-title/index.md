This section covers axis titles

## Axis Title

Sometimes it may not be obvious what a chart's dimension represents. For example, you might see numbers on a chart's axis and not be able to tell if they're millimetres, percentages, dollars, or something else! It can also be helpful to provide extra information. For example, category axis labels can clearly show people's names, but it might be worth knowing that they are a company's best performing sales people.

Luckily, an axis can have a title just like a chart. In the example below we can use axis titles to point out that:

- the horizontal dimension shows desktop operating systems
- the vertical dimension shows their percentage market share

Please see the [API reference](#reference-AgBaseCartesianAxisOptions-title) for axis title styling options like font and colour.
